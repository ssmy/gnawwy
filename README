The standard warnings apply here; gnawwy is in EXTREME-ALPHA. Run at your own risk.

.gnawwyrc must exist in your home directory. A valid .gnawwyrc consists of multiple sections, each of which has a type, a username, and a password. Currently, the only valid type is twitter. Sections are divided by putting the name in brackets; the section name right now doesn't make a difference as to what gnawwy displays. A sample config file, for two Twitter accounts:
[Main twitter account]
type=twitter
username=foo
password=bar

[Other account]
username=baz
password=xyzzy
type=twitter
