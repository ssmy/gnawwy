The standard warnings apply here; gnawwy is in EXTREME-ALPHA. Run at your own risk.

.gnawwyrc must exist in your home directory. A valid .gnawwyrc consists of multiple sections, each of which has a type, a username, and a password. Currently, the only valid types are twitter and email (IMAP only!). Sections are divided by putting the name in brackets; the section name right now doesn't make a difference as to what gnawwy displays. A sample config file, for two Twitter accounts:
[Main twitter account]
type=twitter
username=foo
password=bar

[Other account]
username=baz
password=xyzzy
type=twitter

[E-mail account]
type=email
server=imap.gmail.com
username=plugh
password=plover
ssl=true

Note that e-mail accounts must specify if they use SSL; the default is not.
